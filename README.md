# smart-_antitheft system using IOT(internet of things)
# Overview
The goal of this project is to design a cost-effective anti-theft system that detects intruders and alerts you. We’ll use the following components:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU): This Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller will connect to the internet and allow remote monitoring.
PIR Sensor: The PIR sensor detects motion (infrared radiation) and triggers the system when an intruder is detected.
Blynk Application: We’ll use the Blynk app to control and monitor the system remotely.
 # Implementation Steps
1 Hardware Setup:
 Connect the PIR sensor to the NodeMCU (ESP8266) GPIO pins. Set up the NodeMCU with an internet connection (Wi-Fi).
2  Software Development:
 Write an Arduino sketch (using the Arduino IDE) for the NodeMCU. Use the Blynk library to communicate with the Blynk app. Configure the Blynk app to create a button widget for activation/deactivation.
3  Blynk App Configuration:
Create a new project in the Blynk app.Add a button widget to activate/deactivate the system.Obtain the Blynk authentication token for your project.
4 Code Implementation:
In your Arduino sketch, connect to Wi-Fi using your credentials.Initialize the PIR sensor and set up the Blynk connection.When the button is pressed in the Blynk app, activate the PIR sensor.If motion is detected, send an alert (e.g., via SMS or email) to your phone.
5 Security Considerations:
Change default passwords on the NodeMCU.Encrypt communication channels (e.g., HTTPS for email or SMS).Implement access controls (authentication) for remote monitoring.
